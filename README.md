# Legislator Lookup

This project was built to practice making requests to third-party APIs in Ember. It uses Sunlight Foundation's Congress API to provide users with a variety of information about legislators, committees, recent and upcoming bills, and other information.

## Completed user stories:

* I would like to be able to look up contact information for my legislators by zip so that I can contact them.
* I would like to see the list of committees in the house and in the senate.
* I would like to select a committee and see its subcommittees.
* I would like to see a list of recent bills.
* I would like to be able to select a bill and see more information about it.
* I would like to be able to link to the sponsor of a bill and see details about the sponsor, including contact information. 
* I want to be able to navigate through the site with a navbar.
